In this artifact, we try to apply for the available and functional badges.The reasons are as follows:

- **Available**: The code is available in the repository and can be cloned or downloaded.
- **Functional**: The code has been tested and runs without errors, as confirmed by the successful execution of the main script and the loading of the TCP model.
