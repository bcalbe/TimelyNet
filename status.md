In this artifact, we try to apply for the available and functional badges.The reasons are as follows:

- **Available**: The code is available in the repository and can be cloned or downloaded. A DOI is provided for the repository, ensuring that it is accessible for use and reference.
- **Functional**: The code has been tested and runs without errors, as confirmed by the successful execution of the main script and the loading of the TCP model. We have demonstrated that TimelyNet can adaptively switch architectures based on latency requirements and show their control quality.
